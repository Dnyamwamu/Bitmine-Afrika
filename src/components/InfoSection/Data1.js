  description:
    "Our firm began mining Bitcoin and Ethereum as a single unit for more than 3 years. We realized the high potential of commercial mining and the need to diversify our tokens to safe guard against the volatile Crypto markets. The market has never been stable and this leads to high losses. Our firm was able to create a system of sustainable growth that yields relatively good results, Hence the creation of this platform. Our system helps our clients mine Bitcoin and Ethereum then diversify the said coins into regulated (SEC, ASIC, FCA &amp; CySEC) platforms, DeFi yield farms that have a good APR(annual percentage rate) that in turn gives us a very high APY ( annual percentage yield).",
  description2:
    " Generally our DeFi yield investment have a 30 day lock-in period, this helps us to make quick judgement calls that help secure our funds just in case the fund is no longer sustainable for our growth i.e the APY is low hence we cannot give our client a good return. We also trade on regulated platforms to maximize our returns by using verified technical indicators (no Bots) and professionals to guarantee a return at the end of the month. By doing all the above we were able to see an average of 30% yield every month, this figure is not fixed it fluctuates just as the market does but we can guarantee our clients that their funds will never have a negative return.",
  description3:
    " Our system provides our clients with a 2-7% yield daily on a 28 day lock-in period, this figure is fixed and is non compounding (simple interest).",
